#### 🟧 _Functional connectivity differences between ECoG signals during motor movement vs. motor imagery_
#### 🏛️ Neuromatch Academy Summer School in Computational Neuroscience
##### 🗓️ Jun 2022 - Jul 2022 | 🔗  [Link ➡️](https://github.com/ghosh-r/functional-connectivity-motor-imagery)

* Human brain is responsible for both motor tasks, i.e. when actual movement of some body parts happen, and also for imagery tasks: when the person imagines a movement. This is a project that aims to find functional connectivity among brain areas in both imagined and real motor movements. This project also aims to find the similarity (or lack thereof) between real and imaginary movement in lower dimensional latent space of brain signals using Principal Component Analysis.

**Skills**: Python, PyTorch, Deep Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Team Work
