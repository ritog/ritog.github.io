#### 🟦 Section Leader (Teaching Assistant) of Code in Place Programme - Stanford University
##### 🗓️ Apr 2021 - Jun 2021| 🗺️ Remote

This online course was offered by Stanford University during the COVID-19 pandemic. It brought together 12,000 students and 1,100 volunteer teachers participating from around the world. The course is a 6-week introduction to Python programming using materials from the first half of Stanford’s CS106A course.

As a volunteer section leader, I prepared and taught a weekly discussion section of 8-10 students to supplement professors' lectures.

Received direct training from Stanford Professors Mehran Sahami, Chris Piech, and Julie Zelenski. Received further training from Stanford-appointed teacher mentors.

Taught introductory Python and CS to about 12 students from India, Bangladesh, and the USA. Students were of various ages and came from diverse backgrounds including from Fine Arts backgrounds. For many students, it was the first introduction to programming and CS ever.

Taught five sessions of my own (lasting 1.5 h on average) and a backup session for another.

Taught programming, problem-solving, and CS concepts.

## 📦️ Projects

#### 🟧 _Functional connectivity differences between ECoG signals during motor movement vs. motor imagery_
#### 🏛️ Neuromatch Academy Summer School in Computational Neuroscience
##### 🗓️ Jun 2022 - Jul 2022 | 🔗  [Link ➡️](https://github.com/ghosh-r/functional-connectivity-motor-imagery)

Human brain is responsible for both motor tasks, i.e. when actual movement of some body parts happen, and also for imagery tasks: when the person imagines a movement. This is a project that aims to find functional connectivity among brain areas in both imagined and real motor movements. This project also aims to find the similarity (or lack thereof) between real and imaginary movement in lower dimensional latent space of brain signals using Principal Component Analysis.

Skills: Python, PyTorch, Deep Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Team Work

#### 🟧 _Learn JAX: From Linear Regression to Neural Networks_
#### Personal Project
##### 🗓️ Dec 2021 - Jan 2022 | 🔗  [Link ➡️](https://www.kaggle.com/code/truthr/jax-0)

I introduce the JAX library for solving basic problems in Machine Learning. I explain everything so that a beginner in this framework will find it helpful. Introduced the functional programming paradigm for Deep Learning. 

Won the Google Open Source Software Expert Prize

Skills: JAX, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Written Communication
