    "text": "by Ritobrata Ghosh\n\nIntroduction\nDigital electronics is probably the most impactful and widespread technology now. It forms the basis of all of the chips- from ARM microcontrollers to processors in cellphones, all the way to uberpowerful AMD Threadrippers. In all these cases, digital electronics reign supreme.\nIt is very useful to learn not only about basic principles but also how these principles and the components of Digital Electronics exactly form the basis of the modern world, i.e., how do we go from basic logic gates to fully functional computers.\n\n\nElements of Computing Systems\nDigital Electronics is not only important because it is the base of the modern technology that literally governs our lives, but it makes us better as programmers, and computer scientists.\nWhether we are self-taught programmers or a person with a 4-year CS degree, we were never taught how we go from basic logic gates to CPUs.\nA book that I have come across- The Elements of Computing Systems by By Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken does just that. It teaches you how the basic building blocks of modern computers actually create the computers.\n\n\n\nnand2tetris-book-cover-2ed\n\n\n[Although it shows the new 2nd edition, I am reading the first one]\nIt promises to teach you, actively, how we can start from nothing but a NAND gate and go all the way to a full-fledged computer with an operating system, and a general-purpose programming language that runs on it, which can be used to create anything. The book is also known as nand2tetris.\nI have started reading this book and working through it every Sunday, and I have almost finished a chapter.\n\n\nBuilding Gates from Elementary Gates\nPeople who have taken a Digital Architecture class or a Digital Electronics class will know that NAND (NOT AND) gates are called “universal gates” because some combination of them are able to create any other gates. So, when you have a NAND gate with you, you can create a general-purpose computer with it. And the book makes you do that. It makes you create many logic gates starting from AND, NOT, and OR with nothing but a pre-implemented NAND gate.\nSo, a NAND gate is already implemented and supplied. You first have to create AND, OR, and NOT gates. Then you go on to further create XOR gates, Multiplexors (MUX), Demultiplexors (D-MUX), and multi-bit versions of these gates and basic gates with what you have built previously, viz. AND, OR, NOT, and NAND gates.\nThis is a fascinating task in itself, and very intellectually stimulating.\nThis is where the core of the post comes in.\nI will show you how to implement any Boolean function with nothing but three logic gates. This is a trick worth knowing.\nLet’s start.\n\n\n\nImplementing a Boolean Function\n\nDesign a Boolean Function\nLet’s say we need a Boolean function that behaves in such a way-\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nY\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\nThis truth table tells you that we need such a Boolean function that outputs 1 iff- * A, B, and C, three Boolean variables, are all 0 * only A is 1, B and C are 0 * A and C are 1, B is 0 * A and B are 1, C is 0\nNow, in some situations, you might need to define a Boolean function that behaves as you expect. Do not worry about what this function is doing. Let’s focus on the implementation part.\n\n\nBoolean Expression\nI am assuming that you already know about the basic gates, and how they function.\nSo, in the first step to build a Boolean function, you must create the Boolean expression. Just like a Boolean variable can have two values (0, 1), and a Boolean function can only output two values (0, 1, duh!), a Boolean expression always evaluates to either 0 or 1.\nHow to actually do it?\n\nYou should just note in which cases the function outputs a 1. Focus just on those.\nNote which variables are on (1) and which are off (0).\nKeep the variables unchanged which are 1 in this case, and take a negation of those which are off (in electronics, you would put them through NOT).\nMultiply them together.\nFor these products for each 1 in the output, just add them together.\n\nThat’s it. You have got your Boolean expression.\nLet me go through it step by step.\nIn the first occurrence of 1 in the output, we see that all the input variables are off. So, we get a*, b*, and c*, where a, b, and c are the variables representing inputs A, B, and C, respectively, and x* is the negation of x. We multiply them together, and we get a*b*c*.\nIn the second occurrence of 1, in a similar manner, we get- ab*c*.\nFor the third and fourth occurrences of 1, we get ab*c, and abc*, respectively.\nWe have to add them. And doing so, we get-\n\\[ y = \\overline{a}\\overline{b}\\overline{c} + a\\overline{b}\\overline{c} + a\\overline{b}c + ab\\overline{c} \\]\n[You are required to write cases in the proper order. The first of three variable has these values row-wise- 0-0-0-0-1-1-1-1, the second one varies- 0-0-1-1-0-0-1-1, and the third one- 0-1-0-1-0-1-0-1.]\n\n\nImplementation\nYou might be already aware that negation is passing through a NOT gate, multiplying is just passing through an AND gate, and adding is just an OR gate.\nThe first component a*b*c* can be obtained in this way-\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nAnd here are the second, third, and fourth components-\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nAnd,\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nNow, we have to add them all together, i.e. put these components through an OR gate. The output of the OR gate will be our final output.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nOur final output.\n\n\nHDL: Implement and Test\nNow, if you have ICs lying around, you can quickly test this with a power supply or a 5V cell, and some wires. You will also need a multimeter or LED bulbs to check your output.\nBut, remember, we are building a computer from scratch when following this book. Using thousands of ICs to build a computer is not slightly practical unless you happen to have a contract with TSMC!\nSomething called HDL (Hardware Description Language) is used. It is an intuitive, high-level, special-purpose programming language that you use to design and test chips, and use previously created chips.\nIt is implemented in Java, but you do not have to worry about its implementation, you just need to use it. A GUI program is also supplied to do load and test chips.\nFor example, given a NAND gate, you will design an AND gate this way.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nAs you can see, it is very intuitive, and you can pick it up in 20 minutes.\nAnd, this is how you’d test this:\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nTo write our custom function in HDL, we would do-\n// Custom.hdl\n// this is a part of Hashnode blog Convoluted demo\n\nCHIP Custom {\n    IN a, b, c;\n    OUT out;\n\n    PARTS:\n    Not(in=a, out=nota);\n    Not(in=b, out=notb);\n    Not(in=c, out=notc);\n    And(a=nota, b=notb, out=notanotb);\n    And(a=notanotb, b=notc, out=w1);\n    And(a=a, b=notb, out=anotb);\n    And(a=anotb, b=notc, out=w2);\n    And(a=anotb, b=c, out=w3);\n    And(a=a, b=b, out=ab);\n    And(a=ab, b=notc, out=w4);\n    Or8Way(in[0]=w1, in[1]=w2, in[2]=w3, in[3]=w4, out=out);\n}\nAnd as this is a custom chip, the .tst test file, and .cmp compare file are not supplied. So, for testing this chip, I wrote my own.\nHere is the test (.tst) file-\n// Custom.tst\n// test file for testing custom chip\n// could be found at- https://gist.github.com/ghosh-r/c4e6f5ceb1e7ea2e3ba3601c9de121be\n\n// test file for a custom chip in Convoluted, a Hashnode blog\n\nload Custom.hdl,\noutput-file Custom.out,\ncompare-to Custom.cmp,\noutput-list a%B3.1.3 b%B3.1.3 c%B3.1.3 out%B3.1.3;\n\nset a 0,\nset b 0,\nset c 0,\neval,\noutput;\n\nset a 0,\nset b 0,\nset c 1,\neval,\noutput;\n\nset a 0,\nset b 1,\nset c 0,\neval,\noutput;\n\nset a 0,\nset b 1,\nset c 1,\neval,\noutput; \n\nset a 1,\nset b 0,\nset c 0,\neval,\noutput;\n\nset a 1,\nset b 0,\nset c 1,\neval,\noutput;\n\nset a 1,\nset b 1,\nset c 0,\neval,\noutput;\n\nset a 1,\nset b 1,\nset c 1,\neval,\noutput;\nAnd here is the compare (.cmp) file.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nNatural Language Processing is a fast-advancing field. And it is also one of the fields that require a huge amount of computational resources to make important progress. And although breakthroughs are openly announced, and papers are released in free-to-access repositories such as arXiv, Open Review, Papers with Code, etc., and despite (sometimes) having the code freely available on GitHub, using those language models is not something widely accessible and easy.\nLet me provide more context. BERT is a state-of-the-art encoder language model. It takes days to train the model from the ground up even when using very powerful GPUs that only a few entities have access to. In 2019, NVIDIA used 1472 NVIDIA V100 GPUs to train BERT from scratch in 53 minutes. Yes, 1,472!\nOne estimate puts the cost of training GPT-3, a 175 billion parameter model, for a single training run at $12 Million USD.\nAnd such language models are released every now and then. How do you use these powerful language models for your task?\nHere Hugging Face comes to the scene. They aim to solve this problem by providing pre-trained models, and simple API so that you can use them, fine-tune them, and use the API in your applications.\nIn this article, my goal is to introduce the Hugging Face pipeline API to accomplish very interesting tasks by utilizing powerful pre-trained models present in the models hub of Hugging Face.\nTo follow through this article, you need not have any prior knowledge of Natural Language Processing. I, however, assume minor prior experience in writing Python code.\n\nIn this article, I will go over, describe, and provide examples for the following tasks using Hugging Face pipeline-\n\nSentiment Analysis\nZero-Shot Classification\nText Generation\nMask-Filling\nNamed Entity Recognition\nQuestion Answering\nSummarization\nTranslation\n\n\n\n\nInstalling and Importing\n! pip install transformers[sentencepiece] &gt; /dev/null\nIf you have not seen a pip install with a square bracket in it before, don’t worry. It means that you are installing the transformers package with extra support added for the sentencepiece package. You can find out more about square parentheses installs in pip here.\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nWe will use the utilities available in the pipeline namespace in the transformers library.\n\n\n\nSentiment Analysis\nBefore I begin going through the specific pipelines, let me tell you something beforehand that you will find yourself. Hugging Face API is very intuitive. When you want to use a pipeline, you have to instantiate an object, then you pass data to that object to get result. Very simple! You are soon to see what I mean.\nclassifier_sentiment = pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\")\nThat’s it. You call the pipeline() method with the task you want to accomplish as an argument. And you assign a name to it. You are done now. You can now begin to use the object as a function to achieve what you want. Let’s see an example-\n\n\nSee, it returns a dictionary contained in a list that has two items, label and score. The label part tells us its prediction, and the score tells us its confidence score.\n\nAs an aside, I think they are structured this way because this structure is easily compatible with .json and similar filetypes which are very common in APIs.\n\nLet’s see another example.\n\n\nSee, how the classifier is aware of my emotion about pineapple pizzas? 🙃\n\n\n\nZero-Shot Classification\nWhen you want to classify something using Deep Learning, in many cases you need to train it with labeled examples. This approach is known as Supervised Learning. Even when leveraging transfer learning, you need to train your model with quite a few labeled examples in the domain of your choice. Zero-shot classification is different than that. In this, you use a pre-trained model to classify a given string and some labels of your choice. The model returns you the confidence score for each model.\nLet me show you how this works. First, you instantiate an object and assign it a name just like you did in the case of the Sentiment Analysis pipeline.\nclassifier_zero_shot = pipeline(\"zero-shot-classification\")\nThen you pass a string, along with the labels of your choice to test how well they correspond to your sentence.\n\n\nSee, the given sentence is about a profession, and the model tells you that. And it knows that it is much more related to education than politics.\nEssentially, when you are doing Zero-Shot Classification, you are supplying a string to the pipeline, and also labels. The pipeline returns how accurate those labels are.\n\n\n\nText Generation\nBefore I heard about Deep Learning, I heard about Natural Language Processing, because I heard that you can generate text with it! This is the most exciting part of NLP to me, personally.\nAs the name suggests, this pipeline lets you generate text. It just needs you to supply a prompt, a text that will determine what the generated text will be. Let me show you how.\ngenerator = pipeline(\"text-generation\")\n\n\nSee what I mean! Even with zero training, it can create logically coherent text that is even interesting to read. Robots will take over writers soon 🤖!\nYou can control the maximum length of the output of the pipeline, and even ask for multiple possible outputs, like so-\n\n\n\nWhoa, it’s poetic!\n\nWe can accomplish more interesting things with transfer learning. But that is a story for another day.\n\n\n\nMask Filling\nIn this pipeline, if there is a word that you hide and supply the string with the hidden word, the pipeline will predict that word. This is like magic!\nunmasker = pipeline(\"fill-mask\")\nYou pass the sentence with the masked word, and it will predict it. You can choose the number of predictions you want to see. You just have to pass a value to the top_k parameter.\n\n\n\n\nIt can predict the words quite well. Just remember to mask the word using &lt;mask&gt;.\n\n\n\nNamed Entity Recognition\nThis pipeline recognizes the proper nouns in your sentence. And it also classifies them. Let’s see an example.\nner = pipeline(\"ner\", grouped_entities=True)\nThe grouped_entities parameter just ensures that the pipeline can recognize the names that have more than one word, like, you know, Chocolate Factory.\n\n\nSee how it recognizes a person, his profession, and location on its own, and also labels them as “PER”, “ORG”, and “LOC” (meaning location), respectively.\n\n\n\nQuestion Answering\nThis pipeline provides you with an answer to a question you ask from the context that you provide.\nquestion_answerer = pipeline(\"question-answering\")\n\n\nIt can answer multiple questions from the same prompt.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarization\nThis is one of the most practical tasks that has existed for a long time. Deep Learning really changes the landscape of the task.\nLet’s see it in action.\nsummarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\")\nLet’s summarize a piece of text from a blog post I recently read.\n\n\nNow, that’s something! The efficacy of the summarizer really shocked me. It does this task so well.\n\n\n\nTranslation\nThe translation pipeline translates a piece of text from one language to another. It also lets you choose the language model of your choice.\nFirst, let’s translate a text from English to German. I will use the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de model for this task.\ntranslator_de = pipeline(\"translation\", model=\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de\")\n\n\nNote that you are not explicitly telling the model about the language of the input language or the output language. A language model is only trained for translating from one language to another. It cannot translate other languages. If you want to translate from German to English, you’d have to use another model from the model hub. You can find all the translation models here.\nThe cool thing is that Hugging Face is not limited to Romance languages or European languages in general. Let me show you by translating a piece of text from Bengali.\ntranslator_bn = pipeline(\"translation\", model=\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-bn-en\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI have shown you several pipeline APIs and what they do and how they work.\nHere are the suggested next steps-\n\nExperiment. Play with the pipelines by yourself, try different things with different parameters, run inference on examples of your own, test edge cases, run wild with it. I believe that is the best way to learn.\nDo Projects. Use the knowledge you gained here in simple projects. We only learn by doing.\nHugging Face Course. Hugging Face has recently released a free course where they teach you about Transformers and their library ecosystem. It is a good next step.\nExplore. Explore the Hugging Face website, learn more about their APIs, Services, pre-trained models, and many more things it has to offer.\n\n\nIf you notice any error, mistake, or typo, please feel free to let me know. If something is not clear, please let me know that as well. I will do my best to correct it and will credit you here.\nLet me know if you have any questions at all.\n\n(Originally published as a Notebook on Kaggle.)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "by Rito Ghosh\n\n\nThere are many places that teach you complex number like High School, college classes, YouTube channels, and so on.\nBut they earlier ones often heavy on solving problems by-hand, and almost every time, they do only that.\nThe latter ones focus mainly on shiny visuals or advanced properties that are not intended for the uninitiated.\nThis is a piece written for both people who are getting introduced to Complex Numbers for the first time, and for the people who have studied it in college, and are hazy on the topic. (Why won’t they be? They had to focus on solving boring problems by hand.)\nWhen I saw Jeremy talk about Complex Numbers on the APL study group, I knew I had to write something- I did my Junior year Math paper on Complex Number in High School!\nThe idea is to:\n\nquickly introduce Complex Numbers, and how to work with them\ntalk about their origins: why need complex numbers in the first place?\nshow how they extend the number line\nshow how \\(i\\) works as an operator, and briefly what operators are\ntalk about a real world example, and probable future usage\n\nI will keep it short and crisp.\n\n\n\n\nComplex Numbers, as you might have seen are written like this:\n\\[x = a + ib\\]\nHere, the whole thing in the right-hand side is the number. a is the Real part, and b is the imaginary part.\nDo not get misguided by the names. Imaginary numbers aren’t imaginary at all. They make appearance, or rather, they can represent stuff in real life really well! We will soon see.\nYou can add and subtract complex numbers. You add (or subtract) the real and imaginary parts separately.\nLet me show you.\n\\[(4 + 5i) + (3 + 6i) = (4 + 3) + (5 + 6)i\\]\n\\[ (6i) - (3 + 7i) = (0-3) - (7-6)i = -3 - i\\]\nThey can be multiplied and divided with real numbers and other complex numbers. They work just as you expect them to.\n\\[(3 + 2i)(1 + 4i) = 3 + 12i + 2i + 8i^2\\]\nLet’s not spend too much time here.\nAs how they behave, and more related information can quickly be found- and good ones at that- on internet.\nI suggest the Khan Academy course on Complex Numbers.\n\nOh, I haven’t told you the value of \\(i\\) yet.\n\\(i\\), is defined such that,\n\\[i = \\sqrt(-1), \\text{or}, i^2 = -1\\]\nThat’s it!\n\n\n\n\nThe story goes, when the Greeks were ridden with famines and other troubles, the Oracle of Delphi told them to double the height of the cube made in honor of Apollo.\nThe Greeks could not do it! How could they?\nTo double the size of a cube, you need to find the cube root of 2. The Greeks didn’t know how to that!\nToo bad.\nYou are probably familiar with the story that Pythagoras, frustrated with the fact that the the size of the diagonal of a square with the side of 1 could not be measured, ordered to off someone! Just like that!\nBecause the square root of 2 was not measurable then. It is not a number that you write down like the others.\nHuman beings needed something that could be tamed- numbers that always had roots- no matter what the number was!\nThis is how it came to be. Complex numbers are numbers that always has roots. No matter what.\nAnd with the advent of imaginary numbers, it was possible to calculate the square root of negative numbers, too. But that came later.\n\n\n\n\nThe number line is a simple animal.\nIt is one-dimensional. It extends both ways of zero.\nAnd thus, it was limiting.\nComplex numbers was defined in such a way that they added one extra dimension to the number line.\nIt wasn’t so one-dimensional anymore.\n\n\n\nargand plane\n\n\nPicture: Wikipedia\nNow, numbers weren’t limited to a line, but it was a plane.\nAnd many more operations became possible that simply weren’t before.\n\n\n\n\ni is not simple. Adding it or multiplying it has consequences.\nIf you don’t know yet, very simply, operators are stuff that act on other stuff.\n(No mathematical rigor whatsoever can be expected from the previous line)\nYou know operators. We are talking about it in APL. We use them whenever we code.\nFunctions are also operators.\nThink, for example, about the - operator.\nThis is our friendly negative sign. But add it before a positive number, and the result will be a negative number. The number will no longer remain positive.\nThink about the + operator in math. It takes two numbers, not one. And the result is the sum of both of them.\nOperator takes stuff in it, and spits out results.\ni is also an operator.\nMultiplying a number with i rotates the number by 90 degrees counter-clockwise in the complex plain.\nRotate it twice, and you get the negative of a number. Because, you know, i is the square of -1. And multiplying a number with square of i negates it, i.e. rotates the number by 180 degrees, or throws it to the dark, ehm, negative side.\nThis has important consequences.\n\n\n\n\nThe scope of this piece is very limited.\nBut I will show you one example.\nAlternating Current is not steady, or fixed like Direct Current or DC. AC current, the one powers our home is the only practical form of electricity that can be practically transported from one point to another over a long distance.\nThis form of electricity acts like a wave.\nAnd whenever waves are involved, we have to deal with angles, frequencies, and amplitudes.\nWhen angles become involved, we can use trigonometric functions like cosine and sine.\nAnd complex numbers are related to trigonometric functions via the Euler’s Formula:\n\\[e^{i \\theta} = \\cos{\\theta} + i \\cdot \\sin{\\theta}\\]\nAnd, when we can use the special number, e, we can solve many problems easily because the function returns itself after differentiation and integration.\nThat makes a lot of the things easier.\nWhile this is the reason for using complex numbers in electronics in the first place, they also make life easier for easier calculation and quantity manipulation.\n\n\n\n\nYou might think that complex numbers are such nuisance, and we could have done the same clever things with adding one more dimension to the real number like we do in geometry. Would not a ‘y’ suffice instead of this dimension riddled with ‘imaginary numbers’?\nThe answer is no.\nYou will not have the same behavior then.\nYou won’t be able to get the niceties that is afforded to you via Euler’s formula and the access it provides you to the exponential function.\n\nI hope I was able to give you some intuition about complex numbers, and their uses.\nPlease let me know what you think.\n\nSubscribe to my substack to get posts on your inbox, or subscribe via RSS."

    "text": "Complex Numbers, as you might have seen are written like this:\n\\[x = a + ib\\]\nHere, the whole thing in the right-hand side is the number. a is the Real part, and b is the imaginary part.\nDo not get misguided by the names. Imaginary numbers aren’t imaginary at all. They make appearance, or rather, they can represent stuff in real life really well! We will soon see.\nYou can add and subtract complex numbers. You add (or subtract) the real and imaginary parts separately.\nLet me show you.\n\\[(4 + 5i) + (3 + 6i) = (4 + 3) + (5 + 6)i\\]\n\\[ (6i) - (3 + 7i) = (0-3) - (7-6)i = -3 - i\\]\nThey can be multiplied and divided with real numbers and other complex numbers. They work just as you expect them to.\n\\[(3 + 2i)(1 + 4i) = 3 + 12i + 2i + 8i^2\\]\nLet’s not spend too much time here.\nAs how they behave, and more related information can quickly be found- and good ones at that- on internet.\nI suggest the Khan Academy course on Complex Numbers.\n\nOh, I haven’t told you the value of \\(i\\) yet.\n\\(i\\), is defined such that,\n\\[i = \\sqrt(-1), \\text{or}, i^2 = -1\\]\nThat’s it!"

How could they?\nTo double the size of a cube, you need to find the cube root of 2. The Greeks didn’t know how to that!\nToo bad.\nYou are probably familiar with the story that Pythagoras, frustrated with the fact that the the size of the diagonal of a square with the side of 1 could not be measured, ordered to off someone! Just like that!\nBecause the square root of 2 was not measurable then. It is not a number that you write down like the others.\nHuman beings needed something that could be tamed- numbers that always had roots- no matter what the number was!\nThis is how it came to be. Complex numbers are numbers that always has roots. No matter what.\nAnd with the advent of imaginary numbers, it was possible to calculate the square root of negative numbers, too. But that came later."

We are talking about it in APL. We use them whenever we code.\nFunctions are also operators.\nThink, for example, about the - operator.\nThis is our friendly negative sign. But add it before a positive number, and the result will be a negative number. The number will no longer remain positive.\nThink about the + operator in math. It takes two numbers, not one. And the result is the sum of both of them.\nOperator takes stuff in it, and spits out results.\ni is also an operator.\nMultiplying a number with i rotates the number by 90 degrees counter-clockwise in the complex plain.\nRotate it twice, and you get the negative of a number. Because, you know, i is the square of -1. And multiplying a number with square of i negates it, i.e. rotates the number by 180 degrees, or throws it to the dark, ehm, negative side.\nThis has important consequences."

AC current, the one powers our home is the only practical form of electricity that can be practically transported from one point to another over a long distance.\nThis form of electricity acts like a wave.\nAnd whenever waves are involved, we have to deal with angles, frequencies, and amplitudes.\nWhen angles become involved, we can use trigonometric functions like cosine and sine.\nAnd complex numbers are related to trigonometric functions via the Euler’s Formula:\n\\[e^{i \\theta} = \\cos{\\theta} + i \\cdot \\sin{\\theta}\\]\nAnd, when we can use the special number, e, we can solve many problems easily because the function returns itself after differentiation and integration.\nThat makes a lot of the things easier.\nWhile this is the reason for using complex numbers in electronics in the first place, they also make life easier for easier calculation and quantity manipulation."

    "text": "Image by Pete Linforth from Pixabay\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we will learn about solving Differential Equations with Julia. Differential Equations are everywhere in Science and Engineering problems. And, being able to solve Differential Equations using computers is very convenient. We will use the DifferentialEquations.jl package for solving Differential Equations.\n\n\n\nThis is for people who are already familiar with Differential Equations from Mathematics, and who can code, preferably in Julia. Only the very basics of Julia langauge is required. If you are unfamiliar with Julia, and yet you have non-trivial experience with any of Python, C/C++, Ruby, JavaScript, golang, etc., you are fine, and you can follow along.\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we will only focus on using the high level API of the DifferentialEquations.jl package, and we will learn, from scratch, how to translate first order Differential Equations to Julia, and how to solve them using the library. We will not learn about and code up numerical methods of solving Differential Equations such as Euler’s method, Runge-Kutta methods, etc. Neither we will talk about testing for accuracy, testing convergence of our algorithms. We will simply and plainly have some DEs in our familiar mathematical notation, and then translate them to a form Julia and the library can understand, and then we call high level APIs of the DifferentialEquations.jl library to solve our DEs. That’s it.\nAnd for this post, we are limiting ourselves to First Order Differential Equations.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a step back and discuss normal equations first. Normal equations are equations involving one or more unknown roots. Like this:\n\\[x^2 - 3x - 18 = 0\\]\nAnd you solve this equation for two values of \\(x\\), since this equation is quadratic.\nHow do you create this equation? You formulate an equation from a real-world scenario. Here’s an example, from which you will get the above equation:\n\nA farmer is designing a rectangular vegetable garden. The length of the garden is 3 meters longer than its width. The total area of the garden is 18 square meters. How long are the sides of this garden?\n\nThis is how the equation is created: \\(x(x+3) = 18\\), where \\(x\\) is the length of the smaller side of the garden.\n\n\n\nIn normal equations, we solve the equation to find out values of variables previously unknown to us. In case of Differential Equations, we solve to find out functions previously unknown to us.\nFor normal equations, we find out a relation of the unknown variable with something known to us, concretely.\nIn DEs, we know how an unknown functions changes with time, or another variable. We form our equation with this derivative of an unknown function, and it’s derivatives- one or more.\nIt might look like this:\n\\[\\dfrac{dy}{dx} = -y\\]\nDifferential Equations are used to model real-world happenings, and we aim to solve for that function.\nForming a Differential Equation is only possible when there is a function that changes with another variable, let’s say, time. It is not enough for the output of a function to differ with time, it is also necessary that the function itself changes with time.\nHere are some examples:\n\nAn ideal candle burns at a constant rate, i.e. the rate of burning of wax is the same when the candle is in its full length, as well as when it is nearly finished. But, the growth rate of population is not the same when the population is low as well as when it is hight. Not population itself increases as population increases, but the rate of increase of population also increases with growing population. (Here I am talking about human population in modern age- with the absence of a natural predator, exceptionally good medical facilities, etc.)\nAnother example I can think of is the water emission rate of a hole that is used to empty a water tank. When the water tank is nearly full, the rate of emission of water from the hole is very high, but when the tank is almost empty, the rate of water emission is much lower.\nWhen you have just made coffee, and say it’s temperature is \\(70 ^\\circ C\\), and your surrounding temperature is \\(8 ^\\circ C\\), the time taken by the coffee to reach \\(30 ^\\circ C\\) is much lower than the time it takes to reach \\(8 ^\\circ C\\) from \\(12 ^\\circ C\\). The process of cooling is slower when the temperature difference is lower compared to when the temperature difference is larger.\n\nThese are the situations that you model using Differential Equations.\n\n\n\n\nThere are some situations where finding the exact solution to a Differential Equaion is not possible, or is impractical. This is why we try to find approximate solution. In many situations, this is good enough. When an analytical solution is impossible, numerical olutions is all we have.\n\n\nFor the Differential Equations that we will implement here, and will solve numerically, we will see a graph that will predict the behaviour of the unknown function.\n\n\n\n\nRadioactivity is the phenomena in which an unstable nucleus loses energy by radiation.\nIn radioactive decay, if a sample of radioactive nucleus is kept, through several kinds of radiation, the original sample reduces in mass. If there were \\(n\\) number of nuclei originally, after a certain amount of time, there would be \\(p\\) number of nuclei, where \\(p &lt; n\\).\nWe know that the amount of decay is directly proportional to the number of nuclei present in a sample.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    -\\dfrac{dN}{dt} &\\propto N \\\\\n    \\implies -\\dfrac{dN}{dt} &= \\lambda N\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe sign is negative, because, the rate decreases with decreasing number of nuclei.\nWe will reframe this equation so that we can implement the equation in Julia, and solve it using the solver.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    &-\\dfrac{dN}{dt} \\propto N \\\\\n    &\\implies -\\dfrac{dN}{dt} = \\lambda N \\\\\n    &\\implies \\dfrac{dN}{N} = -\\lambda dt\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nJulia package DifferentialEquations.jl expects functions to be in this format-\nf(du, u, p, t) = p * u\nWhere du is the first derivative, u is the function, t is the timespan for which we want the function’s output, and p is the parameter, or a set of parameters.\nFrom here, we can frame du to be du[1] = -lambda * u[1].\n\n\n\nimport Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DifferentialEquations\")\nPkg.add(\"Plots\")\n\nusing DifferentialEquations, Plots\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction radio_decay!(du, u, p, t)\n    lambda = -p\n    du[1] = lambda * u[1]\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nN = [60.0e18]           # initial condition\n\n# parameter\nlambda = 2.28e6         # in SI unit, s^{-1}\np = lambda\n\n# timespan\ntspan = (0.0, 5e-6)     # timespan is very small because the half-life is very small\n\n\n\n\n\nprob = ODEProblem(radio_decay!, N, tspan, p)\n\n\n\n\n\nsol = solve(prob)\n\n\nplot(sol, title=\"Radioactive Decay\", xlabel=\"Time\", ylabel=\"N\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we have seen in an example before, we know that something cools much faster when the difference between the temperature of that object and the surrounding temperature is comparatively higher. When the difference is lower, it takes a higher amount of time to cool down.\nThe problem was quantified by Isaac Newton himself. Let’s understand it.\nThe temperature of an object, \\(T\\) varies with time, \\(t\\), and it depends on the difference of the temperature of the object and its surroundings- the ambient temperature \\(T_a\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\dfrac{dT}{dt} &\\propto (T - T_a) \\\\\n    \\implies \\dfrac{dT}{dt} &= k(T - T_a)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is a constant of proportionality, the value of which depends on the material.\nNow we will implement this DE in Julia, and solve it using DifferentialEquations.jl library.\n\n\n\nfunction newtons_cooling!(du, u, p, t)\n    k, T_a = p\n    du[1] = k * (u[1] - T_a)\nend\n\nExpected format-\nf(du, u, p, t) = p * u\nWhere du is the first derivative, u is the function, t is the timespan for which we want the function’s output, and p is the parameter, or a set of parameters.\nHere, we are using in-place updating to define du because it is memory efficient, and will be a crucial where there is a system of Differential Equations present.\nHere we have two parameters- k and T_a, and they are related as \\(T_1 = k \\times (T_0 - T_a)\\). That is what we implement on line 3 of the function definition.\n\n\n\n\nT = [80.0]                # Temperature of object\nk = -0.06                 # k, the cooling constant, negative, because cooling\nT_a = 20.0                # the ambient temperature\ntspan = (0.0, 300.0)      # time-period for which we want to tract the values of the function, i.e. temperature of the object\np = (k, T_a)              # defining a tuple of parameters as expected by the library\n\n\n\n\nHere we define the ODEProblem as required by the solver package.\n\nprob = ODEProblem(newtons_cooling!, T, tspan, p)\n\n\n\n\n\nsol = solve(prob)\n\n\nplot(sol,\n    xlabel=\"Time, t\",\n    ylabel=\"Temperature, T\",\n    title=\"Temperature vs. Time\")\n\nWe see very clearly how the value of the function \\(T\\) changes with time.\n\n\n\n\nWe have seen the very basics and intuitive explanation of First Order Differential Equations, and learned about how DifferentialEquations.jl solves DEs, and how to frame DEs according to the format expected by that library.\n\n\n\nI learned a lot about the content of this tutorial from- some amazing teachers that I had in college, and some amazing textbooks like Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering by Riley, Hobson, Bence and Mathematical Methods for Physicists by Arfken, Weber, Harris. I learned about the DE solver package from many content from the creator: Chris Rackauckas, and some example videos from this YouTube channel- doggo dot jl.\n\n\n\nIf you have read this post, and found it interesting or edifying, please let me know. I would like that very much. If you have any criticism, suggestion, or want to tell me anything, just add a comment or let me know privately.

Let’s understand it.\nThe temperature of an object, \\(T\\) varies with time, \\(t\\), and it depends on the difference of the temperature of the object and its surroundings- the ambient temperature \\(T_a\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\dfrac{dT}{dt} &\\propto (T - T_a) \\\\\n    \\implies \\dfrac{dT}{dt} &= k(T - T_a)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is a constant of proportionality, the value of which depends on the material.\nNow we will implement this DE in Julia, and solve it using DifferentialEquations.jl library.\n\n\n\nfunction newtons_cooling!(du, u, p, t)\n    k, T_a = p\n    du[1] = k * (u[1] - T_a)\nend\n\nExpected format-\nf(du, u, p, t) = p * u\nWhere du is the first derivative, u is the function, t is the timespan for which we want the function’s output, and p is the parameter, or a set of parameters.\nHere, we are using in-place updating to define du because it is memory efficient, and will be a crucial where there is a system of Differential Equations present.\nHere we have two parameters- k and T_a, and they are related as \\(T_1 = k \\times (T_0 - T_a)\\). That is what we implement on line 3 of the function definition.\n\n\n\n\nT = [80.0]                # Temperature of object\nk = -0.06                 # k, the cooling constant, negative, because cooling\nT_a = 20.0                # the ambient temperature\ntspan = (0.0, 300.0)      # time-period for which we want to tract the values of the function, i.e. temperature of the object\np = (k, T_a)              # defining a tuple of parameters as expected by the library\n\n\n\n\nHere we define the ODEProblem as required by the solver package.\n\nprob = ODEProblem(newtons_cooling!, T, tspan, p)\n\n\n\n\n\nsol = solve(prob)\n\n\nplot(sol,\n    xlabel=\"Time, t\",\n    ylabel=\"Temperature, T\",\n    title=\"Temperature vs. Time\")\n\nWe see very clearly how the value of the function \\(T\\) changes with time.\n\n\n\n\nWe have seen the very basics and intuitive explanation of First Order Differential Equations, and learned about how DifferentialEquations.jl solves DEs, and how to frame DEs according to the format expected by that library.\n\n\n\nI learned a lot about the content of this tutorial from- some amazing teachers that I had in college, and some amazing textbooks like Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering by Riley, Hobson, Bence and Mathematical Methods for Physicists by Arfken, Weber, Harris. I learned about the DE solver package from many content from the creator: Chris Rackauckas, and some example videos from this YouTube channel- doggo dot jl.\n\n\n\nIf you have read this post, and found it interesting or edifying, please let me know.
